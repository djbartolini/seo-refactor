## Description
The Horiseon website's source code initially contained many instances of `<div>` and other non-semantic elements. I refactored these to semantic elements wherever possible to meet accessibility standards and to ensure developers can more easily identify and edit the elements on the website. Furthermore, I reformatted the CSS and HTML files to follow a more logical structure. I added `alt` attributes to all images. Finally, I added a brief, descriptite `<title>`.
